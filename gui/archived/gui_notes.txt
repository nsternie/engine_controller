The telemetry from flight board is forwarded through the ground board. They are recieved as SEPERATE packets on the computer.

In this packet, there is a variable named BOARD_ID. This will tell you what board the packet come from, and you can structure the gui update accordingly. Board IDs are TARGET_ID_GROUND and TARGET_ID_FLIGHT, and these are globals outlined by my protocol.

Each packet will be the same, I dont wanna deal with seperate packet formats. (I.E. the telemetry config will be the same for both, same variables, etc)

I am starting to get concerned about the computer keeping up, as were starting to deal with a lot of data, so just keep that in mind. We dont have to be efficient, we just have to not be grossly inefficient.

Don't hesitate to ask me if you have questions.
